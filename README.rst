===========

Code for embedding Cartesian sky maps into Healpix maps. 
`Healpix <http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/>`__
is an equal area pixelization of the sky. It is the default pixelization used by
`NPTFit <https://github.com/bsafdi/NPTFit/>`__
which was the main motivation for writing this code. Note the Cartesian map does
not have to be of the entire sky, subregions will be embedded appriately.
